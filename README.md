# Dual-Band-Rectangular-Microstrip-Patch-Antenna
This project proposes the design of an electrically small metamaterial antenna
(ESMA) loaded with electromagnetic electric-LC (ELC) structures. The
proposed antenna is designed to operate at a frequency of 1.57 GHz, which is
the center frequency of the GPS L1 band.. The use of EBG and ELC structures
helps in reducing the size of the antenna and improving its performance. The
ELC structure is used to enhance the radiation efficiency. The simulation results
show that the proposed antenna has a gain of 4.2 dB and an efficiency of 80% at
1.57 GHz. The proposed design is suitable for applications where size is a
critical factor, such as in small satellite communication systems. The proposed
design can be easily scaled to other frequency bands with appropriate parameter
tuning. Finally, the proposed design is validated through measurement results,
which show good agreement with the simulation results. Overall, the proposed
ESMA design with ELC loading offers an attractive solution for miniaturized
antenna design in GPS and other wireless applications.
