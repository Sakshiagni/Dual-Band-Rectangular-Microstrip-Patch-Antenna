# Dual-Band-Rectangular-Microstrip-Patch-Antenna
# This project proposes the design of an electrically small metamaterial antenna
# (ESMA) loaded with electromagnetic electric-LC (ELC) structures. The
# proposed antenna is designed to operate at a frequency of 1.57 GHz, which is
# the center frequency of the GPS L1 band
